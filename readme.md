## Overview 
iPhone client that I wrote back in 2009 that allows users to view traffic conditions and traffic camera live images in NSW.

Note: This was completed but never released. I sought permission from the RTA (Roads and Traffic Authority) to release the application as it was using their data and after over a year of back and forth and dealing with their legal department I stopped pursuing it.
